# GENERA
Genera 8.3 for Symbolics Ivory machines

GENERA is the main JMlisp repository that provides everything required to run Genera 8.3 on Symbolics NXP1000 and XL machines.

It includes a step-by-step procedure, in both Markdown and Text format, that describes how to set up and run Symbolics Genera 8.3 Distribution Worlds and Complete Worlds, and provides the details needed to configure and use Supplier-provided higher-capacity SCSI disks on NXP1000 and XL machines.

In detail, the procedure comprises the following sections:

- Configure serial COM port parameters to control the FEP

- Prepare FEP files required to boot Symbolics Genera

- Access Genera on the NXP1000 from an Intranet host via xterm

- Enable PC and Mac to mount and export a CD-ROM filesystem via NFS

- Restore Distribution Worlds from CD-ROM via the FEP-Tape Activity

- Build an IDS World based on a Genera Distribution World

- Build a complete World on a Supplier-provided SCSI Disk

The repository contains screenshots, accessible via hyperlinks from within the procedure in Markdown format, showing what the Genera screen looks like while implementing key steps and running saved worlds. However, it does not provide the Genera 8.3 distribution and other Symbolics released or Supplier-provided Software for Ivory-based machines, the use of which is subject to your own responsibility with respect to ownership rights.
